# Python Basics

ðŸ“˜ **Stage 1: Python Fundamentals**

This repository contains my beginner-level exercises and code examples as I learn the basics of Python programming.

## âœ… What I'm Learning

In this stage, I focus on building a solid foundation in Python. The topics covered include:

- Variables and data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)
- Arithmetic and logical operators
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions (`def`, arguments, return)
- Lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples
- String operations
- Input and output from the console
- Basic error handling with `try` / `except`
